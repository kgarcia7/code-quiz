#Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

# Description
As I progress on my journey to become a full-stack web developer, it's probable that I'll encounter coding assessments, potentially as part of an interview process. These assessments typically involve a mix of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To familiarize myself with these tests and provide an opportunity to apply the skills I've gained in this module, this week's Challenge invites me to build a timed coding quiz featuring multiple-choice questions. I'll be developing this app to run in the browser, incorporating dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by the JavaScript code that I'll be writing. The aim is to create an application with a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. The coursework for this week is designed to equip me with all the necessary skills to succeed in completing this assignment.

## User Story
